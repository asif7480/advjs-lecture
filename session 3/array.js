// array is a data structure in js which can be used to store multiple values in a single variable
// Individual array can be accessed by using its indexes which starts from 0 which means starting index value is 0 
// and last index value is n -1 which means that if array contains five values then last index will be 4 

let arr = [2,4,5,6,7]

// prints entire array
console.log(arr);


// prints first value of arry
console.log(arr[0]);


// prints first and fourth value of array
console.log(arr[0], arr[3]);
